# Water level detection using ESP8266 Wifi
Developed a water level detection system using an ultrasonic sensor and an ESP8266. The system measures the water level in real-time and controls a pump based on predefined thresholds. The pump turns off when the water level is below 20 cm and turns on when the level exceeds 80 cm. The water level and pump status are continuously monitored and displayed via the Serial Monitor.
